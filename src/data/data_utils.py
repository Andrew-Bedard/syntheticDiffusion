    Transform and normalize an image from the CIFAR-10 dataset using PyTorch transforms.

        tensor: The transformed image as a PyTorch tensor, with pixel values
        normalized to the range [-1, 1]. The tensor has shape (3, H, W), where H and
        W are the height and width of the original image, respectively.

    Notes:
        This function applies the following transformations to the input image in
        sequence: convert the image to a PyTorch tensor, then normalize the pixel
        values of each color channel to have mean 0.5 and standard deviation 0.5.
        The resulting tensor has shape (3, H, W), where 3 corresponds to the three
        color channels (red, green, and blue).

        This function assumes that the input image has already been loaded using
        PyTorch's ImageFolder dataset, and is therefore in PIL Image format or
        numpy.ndarray format.
